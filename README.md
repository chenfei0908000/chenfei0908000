- 👋 Hi, I’m @chenfei0908000， I am Chinese, from the New Federal State of China. 
- 👀 I am devoted to the study of the four prices of trades, they are the opening price, the closing price, the high price, and the low price. I have discovered and defined the basic logical relationships through which rational trading behavior can be made
- 🌱 Now, I want to program them into a computer, so I need collaborators.
